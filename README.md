A multifidelity glue framework to connect structural tools like Nastran to SUAVE for multi-fidelity conceptual aircraft design.

Makes it possible to generate aerodynamic loads and generate the relevant sizing files for Nastran

Developed as part of work performed in the Aerospace Design Lab, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University
